# Scenario


# Question 1: Which host gets notified when the 1756-L61/B LOGIX5561 card undergoes a PLC status change?
PLCs can have different states and in some cases, it may be considered normal for their state to change during normal operations. Being able to identify and detect state changes can inform of normal or malicious intent

To identify any PLC state changes being propogated through the network we must first identify the category of this event from dragos, through looking for any fields related to status change we see the
**PLC Status Change** category, which logs all events where a change in the PLC's state is idenfified. This brigns up all PLC's in the environment and shows us the traffic related to notifying the concerned hosts.
Armed with this we can identify the field responsible for denoting the PLC logic card. Within the message body there is a section describign which PLC card made the change, we can sue this to drilldown into 
only the PLC we are interested. We are now presented with multiple entries detailing different src ips for the card with the same mac address (**00:00:BC:3C:DB:0D**) notifying multiple IP addresses of the status change.

The early results are likely when the PLC was just being configured as it continues to add more entries to the destination which needs to be identified, after a while we see that all destinations have been configured and the
PLC switches ip address, this is still the same PLC just using a different src_ip, it notifies many destinations of its PLC status change.

| Hostname                 | IP Address      | Notes / Role (from context)               |
|---------------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| ews-hq-siemens01.local    | 192.168.1.200   | Siemens engineering workstation (EWS)     |
| desktop-mln7j12.local     | 192.168.96.200  | User desktop (engineering/maintenance)    |
| ews-hq-rslogix01.local    | 192.168.1.100   | Rockwell RSLogix engineering workstation  |
| *(no hostname in logs)*   | 192.168.97.6    | Host notified by PLC (role unclear, likely HMI or historian) |

The main host being notified is 192.168.97.6, but all other dest_ip's are sent the same update.

Query: `index="dragos" category="PLC Status Change" "1756-L61/B LOGIX5561"  | sort descending`

Answer: 192.168.97.6

# Question 2: Based on the previous question, who is the manufacturer of the card?

Answer: allen-bradley

# Question 3: Based on the answer in question 102, answering in MB, how large is the user memory on the previously identified controller?
Knowing technical specifications of hardware can help with system designs and requirements. This can include software and hardware specs.

We can simply look up the specs online

Answer: 2

# Question 4: What is the built-in COM (communication) port?
Along with knowing technical specifications of hardware, knowing built-in ports can help with upgrading systems and determining compatibility.

COM ports whilst slowly becoming obselete are still found in many PLC's to this day, they can be used for PLC programming by connecting to a PC and may even be connected to simple field devices, they are also
used to connect PLC's to HMI's.

Ethernet ports are the new normal providing much faster speeds and encapsulating protocols like Modbus RTU into Modbus TCP, it also allows the PLC to communicate with many devices at once in a network topology

We can research the built in COM port specifications online

Answer: RS-232

# Question 5: What is the destination IP address of the TCP reverse shell that was detected?

Dragos provides many helpful dashboards for analysing the network from a general perspective, we have a section dedicated to **Threat Behaviour** which identifies any traffic that may pose a threat to the security posture. Alerts are categorised by their severity and if we go from highest to lowest we quickly identify a record with the category **SQL Server xp_cmdshell observed**.
Screenshot: <img width="1851" height="911" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0014dabe-6a1b-4d04-9b5e-d06789dde680" />

This tells us an SQL Server(10.0.128) has made a connection to a C2 endpoint (10.0.0.31) using the xp_cmdshell functionality which allows the sql server to execute commands on the underlying operating system, this can be used to download malware or spawn rever shells to C2 endpoints or pivot to another host. 

We can drill down into the records involved with this threat behaviour by filtering by category and we will get results displaying traffic related to xp_cmdshell.

Screenshot: <img width="1894" height="853" alt="dragos-xp_cmsdhell" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e5d2559-4e8e-4aa6-9d53-b5d7bf94c174" />

Now that we know the attacker was using 10.0.0.31 as a C2 endpoint to spawn a reverse shell we can see if there is any other traffic or alerts generated with these machines.

Query: `index="dragos" dest_ip="10.0.0.131" src_ip="10.0.0.128" | table category, body`

Screenshot: <img width="1911" height="849" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b58bcfa-1d08-4540-b593-6ec97428af2c" />

**Further investigation**
Now that we have the alert we would begin to gather context about the attack using network and EDR logs to identify:
- Command ran to initiate reverse shell
- Further commands ran on the system
- user context ( What privileges were available)
- Further connection attempts made by 10.0.0.128 to internal or external resources
- Event IDs 4624 (logon), 4688 (process creation), 5140 (file access)

Answer: 10.0.0.131

# Question 6: What was the hostname that was connected to with a SMB command shell?
Using dragos's category feature to look for any alerts produced involving the SMB protocolwe can quickly create a timeline of the smb activity detected by dragos and determine how it was abused and what systems were affected.

Query:`index="dragos" category="*SMB*" | table _time src_ip, src_name, dest_ip, dest_name, category, body | reverse`

Screenshot: <img width="1903" height="846" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf52793b-cba1-4ad6-b4f4-f1a56a79e96f" />

We can see that their are multiple entries regarding smb traffic, we can see that command shell comes up quite often, we can drill down to find this

Query: `index="dragos" category="SMB Command Shell Activity"  | table  _time src_ip, src_name, dest_ip, dest_name, dest_host category, body  | reverse`

Screenshot: <img width="1884" height="659" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fb6aa11-183b-4e8e-8506-b50d4d0a5af6" />

Answer: rslogix5000

## Question 7: If you were going to use the tool 'pylogix', what config file parameter needs to change in order to set the slot number?
PyLogix is a Python library used to communicate with Allen-Bradley (Rockwell Automation) PLCs over the Ethernet/IP protocol. Itâ€™s commonly used in Industrial Control System (ICS) environments for monitoring and interacting with PLCs programmatically.

We can find guidance on the pylogix tool on github: https://github.com/dmroeder/pylogix

Answer: comm.ProcessorSlot

## Question 8: Using pylogix, what value is used to read a tag by routing through another device?

## Question 9: Using pylogix, what value is used to enumerate and get all controller and program tags?

Answer: GetTagList()

## Question 10: On which hostname was the Metasploit alert for detected windows/speak_pwned run against?

This is a proof of concept used to demonstrate the ability for a remote system to induce a function on a windows pc saying its been pwned and is used for testing exercises. 

We know that the category is likely to inlcude metasploit, and we know that the windows/speak_pwned module is used, we can filter for any traffic with this category and it quickly tells us that
srv-hq-bkup01(192.168.193.12) was able to use metsasploit to access srv-hq-nas01(192.168.193.14).
Query: `index=* sourcetype=dragos_alert  category ="*windows/speak_pwned*" 
| table _time, src_host, src_ip, dest_host, dest_ip, category`

Screnshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a255bd9-93d8-4f3b-b0a8-2e8c565cb046" />

We could then pivot to other dragos logs including metasploit to gather information on the threat behaviour, then we can pivot to network and enpoint logs to determine whether the attacking ip made any further commands or exfiltrated any data.

Query: `index=* sourcetype=dragos_alert  category ="*Metasploit*" 
| table _time, src_host, src_ip, dest_host, dest_ip, category`

Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca7f2715-186b-434b-bcef-8f4b9c75c8e7" />

We can also look into the activtities related to the attacking ip to build a picture of their actions

Query: `index=* sourcetype=dragos_alert  "192.168.193.12" 
| table _time, src_host, src_ip, dest_host, dest_ip, category`
Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a02bb99-f694-4c76-8fd6-a193cb1d1401" />

We can see that the attacker first attempted to execute commands remotely on the rslogix5000 host, transferred a file to the host then moved on to the host in question and ran metasploit

Answer: srv-hq-nas01

## Question 11: What offensive PowerShell tool was used by the adversary?

We know that this will produce some alert related to powershell, we can search for any categories involving powershell and look from the beginning to the end, we can see that initially one host executed powershell scripts using smb likely done by the attacker, next we see the 10.0.30.129 has attempted to send traffic to 10.0.30.131 using signatures common with empire c2 communications, whether the 10.0.30.129 executed empire using powershell or 10.0.30.131 has launched a malicious PHP listener.

Query: `index=* category="*Powershell*" | table  _time, src_host, src_ip, src_name, dest_host, dest_ip, dest_name, body  | reverse`
Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70e42dc2-77d6-4350-83b0-4e3d30109060" />

Answer: Empire

## Question 12: MS17-101 was run against a target. What was the target's MAC address?

Query: `index=* category="*EternalBlue*" | table  _time, src_host, src_ip, src_name, dest_host, dest_ip, dest_name, dest_mac, body  | reverse`

Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60962d26-a882-4751-84cf-1b7c999088a3" />

Answer: F8:DB:88:3E:83:A0

## Question 13: Which host attempted to modify the Usermemory object on the host 192.168.1.6 more than once?
This involves looking for any occurences of the usermemory object in our alerts

Query: `index=* dest_ip="192.168.1.6" "*Usermemory*"| table  _time, src_host, src_ip, src_name, dest_host, dest_ip, dest_name, dest_mac, body  | reverse`

Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e555140-36f8-46c6-ae9e-ca3e4005d528" />

This tells us 192.168.1.6 is a PLC, we could now look into any traffic related to that ip to see other actions taken

Query: `index=* dest_ip="192.168.1.6" | table  _time, src_host, src_ip, src_name, dest_host, dest_ip, dest_name, dest_mac, body  | reverse`

Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb2c86ed-f222-4023-ad9c-8a9b70e2e28d" />

Answer: 192.168.1.100

## Question 14: 
This suggests that an alert was generated from 192.168.1.6 notifying 192.168.1.200 that the specified command was not authorised and therefore unsuccessful, the body of the alert gives us details as to what was rejected by the PLC.
Query: `index=*  src_ip="192.168.1.6" dest_ip="*192.168.1.200*"  category="CIP Error (Service Not Supported) Indicating Unauthorized Command Message" | table  _time, src_host, src_ip, src_name, dest_host, dest_ip, dest_name, dest_mac, body   | reverse`

## Question 20: What protocol does Pycomm3 to use to read and write tag values?

Answer: EtherNet/IP

## Question 21: What type of data can be used with the â€˜request_dataâ€™ command?
Given that pycomm is an open source tool we can use their github to determine key characteristics of its methods using the class responsible for defining the request_data method, this is where the programmer
will define the data types that the request method can interact with.

Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f76391cf-653d-4cf0-9bc5-f3e4a5fe2c87" />

Answer: ANY


## Question 22:  In alphabetical order, and separated by commas, i.e. a,b,c - What three drivers come installed with pycomm3?

When reading the README.md for pycomm3 it is explicitly stated that three drivers are avialable
"
pycomm3 includes 3 drivers:

CIPDriver
This driver is the base driver for the library, it handles common CIP services used by the other drivers. Things like opening/closing a connection, register/unregister sessions, forward open/close services, device discovery, and generic messaging. It can be used to connect to any Ethernet/IP device, like: drives, switches, meters, and other non-PLC devices.
LogixDriver
This driver supports services specific to ControlLogix, CompactLogix, and Micro800 PLCs. Services like reading/writing tags, uploading the tag list, and getting/setting the PLC time.
SLCDriver
This driver supports basic reading/writing data files in a SLC500 or MicroLogix PLCs. It is a port of the SlcDriver from pycomm with minimal changes to make the API similar to the other drivers. Currently this driver is considered legacy and it's development will be on a limited basis."

Answer: CIPDriver,LogixDriver,SLCDriver

## Question 23: What type of PLCs can be used with Pycomm3

We already know from the github README.md that pycomm3 is made for allen-bradley PLC's which are manufactured by rockwell automation

Answer: allen-bradley,rockwell automation

This returns two entries which seems to be related to NAT translation of the internal ip address to a public ip address, we are concerned with the internal ip address
Answer: 10.1.0.101

## Question 25: What popular shell was used to execute commands on remote hosts from the MSSQL server?
We already discovered this when looking at the database traffic
Answer: xp_cmdshell

## Question 26: By default that command is disabled. What command is used to enable it?

Obviously xp_cmshell is disabled by default due to its prolific abuse by attackers to perform lateral movement, execute commands or escalate privileges and obtain reverse shells.

It can be enabled using `EXEC sp_configure 'xp_cmdshell', 1;
RECONFIGURE;`

Answer: sp_configure

## Question 27: Asset 21151 was potentially compromised. What was the first notification related to the asset after compromise was detected?

Dragos can identify assets of interest and tag them to monitor their access across the network. We can search for any alerts related to this asset,

Query: `index=* "*Asset 21151*"| table  _time, category,body 
|  reverse`

Screenshot: <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78e42fa2-496e-46fa-9c21-e2a9c70d36ca" />
