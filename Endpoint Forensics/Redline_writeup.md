# Scenario
As a member of the Security Blue team, your assignment is to analyze a memory dump using Redline and Volatility tools. Your goal is to trace the steps taken by the attacker on the compromised machine and determine how they managed to bypass the Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS). Your investigation will identify the specific malware family employed in the attack and its characteristics. Additionally, your task is to identify and mitigate any traces or footprints left by the attacker.

# Introduction
This lab challenges us to use Redline and volatility 3 to perform memory forensics analysis on a memory dump of a macine which is believe to be compromised by an attacker. This will involve using the snapshot of the pc at the time of
the malwares execution to determine the TTPs used by the attacker to compromise the PC.

## Question 1 What is the name of the suspicious process?
